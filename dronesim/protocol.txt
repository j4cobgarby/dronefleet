DRONE to SERVER:

A newly connecting drone can send the character 'N' to the server to register itself.

Also, a drone can send the character 'S' followed by values from any sensors the
drone wants to send, separated by ':' characters, like this:

    S{sensor}:...:{sensor}

The format for each sensor can be one of:

    Gyroscope:
    GX/Y/Z

    Accelerometer:
    AX/Y/Z

    Barometer:
    BX

    Position:
    PX/Z

    Absolute Rotation:
    RYAW/PITCH/ROLL

    Absolute Position (Translation):
    TX/Y/Z

So, a possible message would be:

    SG1.2/6/2.3:A0/0/2

Representing values for both the gyroscope and the accelerometer.

####

SERVER to DRONE:

The server needs to tell the drone what percentage to set its motors to, so it
can send the following message type:

    MA/B/C/D

To set the speeds of the motors A, B, C, and D. The values can be between 0 and
100, as a percentage of the max motor speed. For example:

    M60.3/80.05/50/73

Additionally, if a message begins with the character 'I', then, its interpreted
as simply being information, which the server may just print to the terminal.
